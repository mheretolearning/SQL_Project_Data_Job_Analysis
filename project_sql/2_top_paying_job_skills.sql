    -- If we do not limit first ten jobs, then result will be different. Because important part of this problem to find the first 10 jobs. Then the other conditions are coming....
    -- this query gives us the first highest ten Data analyst jobs requires those skills. 
    -- we have to use CTE to get the correct result, because each job postings might be including more than 10 skills. if we do not use cte and starts the query by limiting 10, then the result has to filter from ten row results
